Analyze this codebase to generate or update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for guiding AI coding agents.

Focus on discovering the essential knowledge that would help an AI agents be immediately productive in this codebase. Consider aspects like:

- The "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand - major components, service boundaries, data flows, and the "why" behind structural decisions
- Critical developer workflows (builds, tests, debugging) especially commands that aren't obvious from file inspection alone
- Project-specific conventions and patterns that differ from common practices
- Integration points, external dependencies, and cross-component communication patterns

Source existing AI conventions from `**/{.github/copilot-instructions.md,AGENT.md,AGENTS.md,CLAUDE.md,.cursorrules,.windsurfrules,.clinerules,.cursor/rules/**,.windsurf/rules/**,.clinerules/**,README.md}` (do one glob search).

Guidelines (read more at https://aka.ms/vscode-instructions-docs):

- If `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists, merge intelligently - preserve valuable content while updating outdated sections
- Write concise, actionable instructions (~20-50 lines) using markdown structure
- Include specific examples from the codebase when describing patterns
- Avoid generic advice ("write tests", "handle errors") - focus on THIS project's specific approaches
- Document only discoverable patterns, not aspirational practices
- Reference key files/directories that exemplify important patterns

Make it clear that:

- We don't want AI char shortcuts in the codebase comment block or documentation, ensure alwayse use their actual character or string equivalent.

| use      | don't use   |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `->`     | `→`         |
| `<-`     | `←`         |
| `<->`    | `↔`         |
| `-->`    | `───▶`      |
| `>=`     | `≥`         |
| `<=`     | `≤`         |
| `!=`     | `≠`         |
| `*`      | `×`         |
| `/`      | `÷`         |
| `-`      | ` —` or `–` |
| `IN`     | `∈`         |
| `NOT IN` | `∉`         |
| `...`    | `…`         |

- In source code, comment block should not be too much verbose, should feel human

IMPORTANT: don't hallucinate or invent go through the entire code base to understand before generate the copilot-instructions.md or docs. Focus on what can be directly observed in the codebase, not on idealized practices or assumptions.

Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for the user, then ask for feedback on any unclear or incomplete sections to iterate.
